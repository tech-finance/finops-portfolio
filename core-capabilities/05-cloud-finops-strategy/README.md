## Governance Policies

### Tagging Standards

**Mandatory Tags:**
```yaml
- Cost-Center: team/department identifier
- Owner: person responsible
- Project: project/application name
- Environment: dev/staging/prod
- Business-Unit: LOB identifier
- Created-Date: YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Governance:**
- Automated tag validation
- Untagged resource alerts
- Monthly tag compliance reports
- Tag-based access control

### Resource Approval Workflow

```
1. Requestor submits resource request
   ↓
2. Manager reviews & approves
   ↓
3. Cost review (> $1K/month)
   ↓
4. Approval granted
   ↓
5. Resource provisioned
   ↓
6. Tagged & added to tracking
```

### Budget Controls

- **Department-level budgets:** Set quarterly
- **Project-level budgets:** Set per project
- **Alerts:** 50%, 75%, 90% of budget
- **Enforce:** Hard limits on production budgets
- **Review:** Monthly budget vs. actual

---

## Cost Allocation Model

### Chargeback Methodology

**Direct Costs:**
- Compute resources (VMs, containers)
- Database instances
- Storage
- Data transfer

**Shared Costs (Allocated):**
- Shared infrastructure (networking, management)
- Platform services (monitoring, backup)
- Central FinOps team

**Allocation Drivers:**
- CPU/Memory utilization (60%)
- Storage usage (20%)
- Transaction volume (10%)
- Headcount (10%)

### Reporting
